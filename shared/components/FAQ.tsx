                        A facet is a set elements that construe a feature. For instance, a login form could be considered a facet, with the elements being email, password and the login button.

                        Facet abstracts the rollout process that is commonly achieved by using feature flags. At facet, we believe that engineers shouldn't spend their time maintaining manual configurations like the ones feature flags require. We enable engineers to focus on building their product, while we build the rollout abstractions to support them throughout the journey.

                        Yes! By default, facets are declared with a global scope. You can change their visibility to non-global, which means that their rules will be applied to the current domain (pathname). Click on the desired facet {'->'} select the "more options button", and click on the "global" checkbox.
